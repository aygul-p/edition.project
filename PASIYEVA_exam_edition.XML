            <head>Chapter 1: WINCHESTER AND CENTRAL HAMPSHIRE</head>
            <p>The foundations of the ancient capital of <placeName ref="#England">England</placeName> were probably laid
                when the waves of <eventName ref="#Celtic_conquest">Celtic conquest</eventName> that had submerged the <eventName ref="#Neolithic">Neolithic</eventName> men
                stilled to tranquillity. The earliest records left to us are many generations later and they are obscure and doubtful, but according to
                <persName ref="#Vigilantius">Vigilantius</persName>, an early <roleName>historian</roleName> whose lost writings have been quoted
                by those who followed him, a great <orgName ref="#Christian church" type="church">Christian church</orgName> was re-erected
                here in <date when="0164" type="AD">A.D. 164</date> by <persName ref="#Lucius">Lucius</persName>, <roleName>King</roleName> of the <persName ref="#Belgae" type="population">Belgae</persName>, on the site of a
                building destroyed during a temporary revival of paganism. The <persName ref="#Roman" type="nationality">Roman</persName>
                <roleName>masters</roleName> of <persName ref="#Lucius">Lucius</persName> called his capital, rebuilt under their tuition,
                <placeName ref="#Venta Belgarum" type="town">"Venta Belgarum"</placeName>. The <persName ref="#British">Bitish name</persName> name--<placeName ref="#Caer Gwent" type="town">Caer Gwent</placeName>--belonged to the
                original settlement. The size and boundaries of both are uncertain.
                <term type="archeological">Remains</term> of the <eventName>Celtic age</eventName> are practically non-existent beneath
                <placeName ref="#Winchester">Winchester</placeName>, though the surrounding hills are plentifully strewn with
                them, and if <placeName ref="#Roman_antiquities" type="building">Roman antiquities</placeName> occasionally turn up when the
                foundations of new buildings are being prepared, any plan of the <placeName ref="#Roman_town" type="towm">Roman town</placeName>
                is pure conjecture. The true historic interest of <placeName ref="#Winchester" type="city">Winchester</placeName>, and
                historically it is without doubt the most interesting city in <placeName ref="#England">England</placeName>,
                dates from the time of those <persName ref="#West_Saxon">West Saxon</persName> chiefs who gave it the
                important standing which was eventually to make it the metropolis of the
                <persName ref="#English">English</persName>.The early history of <placeName ref="#Winchester" type="city">Winchester</placeName>is the history of <placeName ref="#Wessex" type="nation">Wessex</placeName>, and when
                <persName ref="#Cerdic">Cerdic</persName>decided to make it the capital of his new kingdom, about <date when="0520">520</date>,
                it was probably the only commercial centre in the state, with
                <placeName ref="#Southampton" type="town">Southampton</placeName> as its natural port and allied town. As the peaceful
                development of <placeName ref="#Wessex" type="nation">Wessex</placeName> went on, so the population and trade of the
                capital grew until in a little over a hundred years, when <persName ref="#Birinus">Birinus</persName> came
                from over seas bearing the cross of the faith that was soon to spread
                with great rapidity over the whole of <placeName ref="#Southern_England" type="borough">Southern England</placeName>, he found here
                a flourishing though pagan town. After the conversion of <roleName>King</roleName> <persName ref="#Cynegils">Cynegils</persName>
                the first <placeName ref="#Wessex" type="nation">Wessex</placeName> <roleName>bishopric</roleName> was founded at <placeName ref="#Dorchester" type="town">Dorchester</placeName>near the banks of
                the <placeName ref="#Thames" type="river">Thames</placeName>, but by <date when="0674">674</date>this was removed to the capital where there had
                been built a small church dedicated to <persName ref="#St_Peter">St. Peter</persName> and <persName ref="#Paul">Paul</persName>, probably on
                the site now occupied by the cathedral and originally by the church of <persName ref="#Lucius">Lucius</persName> and its predecessor.</p>
          
            <p>The great structure we see to-day is remarkable in many ways. It is
               the longest <term type="architectural_style">Gothic</term> building in the world, and is only exceeded by 
               <persName ref="#St_Peter">St.Peter</persName>'s in <placeName ref="#Rome" type="city">Rome</placeName>. In spite of the disappointment the stranger
               invariably experiences at his first sight of the squat tower and
                straight line of wall, its majestic interior, and the indefinable
                feeling that this is still a temple and not a mere museum, will soon
                give rise to a sense of reverent appreciation that makes one linger
                long after the usual round of <emph>"sights"</emph> has been accomplished. The war
                memorial, dignified and austere, that was placed outside the west
                front in the <date when="1921" type="autumn">autumn of 1921</date>, is a most effective foil to the
                singularly unimposing pile of stone and glass behind it. But, however
                it may lack the elegance of the usual west <emph>"screen"</emph>, this end of
                <orgName ref="#Winchester_cathedral" type="cathedral">Winchester Cathedral</orgName> has the great merit of being architecturally true.</p>
  
            <p>Of the first <term type="architectural_style">Saxon</term> building nothing remains. In this <persName ref="#Egbert">Egbert</persName> was
                crowned <roleName>King</roleName> of the <persName ref="#English" type="population">English</persName> in <date when="0827">827</date>. It was strongly fortified by <persName ref="#St_Swithun">St.Swithun</persName>, who was <roleName>bishop</roleName> for ten years from <date when="0852">852</date>. At his urgent request
                he was buried in the churchyard instead of within the cathedral walls.
                Another generation wishing to honour the saint commenced the removal
                of the relics. On the day set aside for this--<eventName>Swithun's day</eventName>--a
                violent storm of rain came on and continued for forty days, thus
                giving rise to the old and well known superstition of the forty days
                of rain following <eventName>St. Swithun's</eventName> should that day be wet.</p>
                  
            <p>Under <roleName>Bishop</roleName> <persName ref="#Swithun">Swithun</persName>'s direction the clergy and servants of the
               cathedral successfully resisted an attack by the <persName ref="#Danes" type="population">Danes</persName> when the
               remainder of the city was destroyed. Soon after this, in the midst of
               the <eventName>Danish terror</eventName>, <persName ref="#Alfred">Alfred</persName> became <roleName>king</roleName> and here he founded two
               additional religious houses, <orgName ref="#St_Mary_s_abbey" type="abbey">St. Mary's Abbey</orgName>,
               the <orgName ref="#Benedictine_Nunnaminister"  type="nunnery">Benedictine "Nunnaminster"</orgName>; and <orgName ref="#Newminister" type="abbey">Newminster</orgName> on the north side of the cathedral. Of
               this latter <persName ref="#Grimald" type="abbot">St. Grimald</persName> was abbot. Nearly a hundred years later, in
               <persName ref="#Edgar">Edgar</persName>'s reign, the cathedral itself became a monastery, with <roleName>Bishop</roleName> <persName ref="#Athelwold">Athelwold</persName>
               as first abbot. He rebuilt the cathedral, dedicating it to
               <persName ref="#St_Swithun">St. Swithun</persName>; it had been originally dedicated to <persName ref="#St_Peter">St.Peter</persName> and <persName ref="#Paul">Paul</persName>.
               Within this fabric <persName ref="#Canute">Canute</persName> and his wife were buried; that earlier
               <roleName>Conqueror</roleName> of the <persName ref="#English">English</persName> having made <placeName ref="#Winchester" type="city">Winchester</placeName> his imperial capital.
               A few years later, on <eventName>Easter Day</eventName>, the coronation of <persName ref="#St_Edward_1">St. Edward</persName> took
               place with great pomp. Soon after the advent of <persName ref="#William_I">William I</persName>, who made
               <district ref="#Winchester" type="city">Winchester</district> a joint metropolis with <district ref="#London" type="city">London</district> and was crowned in both, the
               building of the great <orgName ref="#Norman_church" type="church">Norman church</orgName> by <roleName>Bishop</roleName> <persName ref="#Walkelyn">Walkelyn</persName> was begun; the
               consecration taking place on <eventName>St. Swithun's day</eventName> <date when="1093">1093</date>. Of this structure
               the crypt and transepts remain practically untouched. The nave, though
               <term type="architectural_style">Norman</term> at its heart, has been altered in a most interesting way to
               <term type="architectural_style">Perpendicular</term> without scrapping the earlier work. <placeName ref="#Walkelyn_s_tower" type="tower">Walkelyn's tower</placeName>
               fell in and ruined the choir in <date when="1107">1107</date>, legend says as a protest against
               the body of <persName ref="#Rufus">Rufus</persName> being placed beneath it. The present low tower
               immediately took its place. <roleName>Bishop</roleName> de <persName ref="#Lucy">Lucy</persName> was responsible for
               rebuilding the Early English <orgName ref="#Early_English_choir" type="cathedral">Early English choir</orgName> about <date when="1200">1200</date>. The famous <roleName>Bishop</roleName> <persName ref="#Wykeham">Wykeham</persName>
               completed the work of his predecessor, <persName ref="#Edyngton">Edyngton</persName>, in rebuilding
               the west front, and he it was who beautified the nave. The great east
               window dates from about <date when="1510">1510</date>; the lady chapel being rather earlier in date.</p>
                  
             <p>The extreme length of the cathedral is <term type="measure">556 feet</term>; the breadth of the
               transepts being <term type="measure">217 feet</term> feet, and as the nave is entered the majestic
              proportions of the great church will be at once appreciated.
              Particular notice should be taken of the black font brought from
              <placeName ref="#Tournai" type="city">Tournai</placeName>; it has the story of <persName ref="#St_Nicholas">St. Nicholas</persName> carved upon it. The
              situation of this and the tombs and other details will be quickly
              identified by reference to the plan. On the south side is the chantry
              of <roleName>Bishop</roleName> <persName ref="#Wykeham">Wykeham</persName>, now fitted up as a chapel. Farther east is a
              modern effigy, much admired, of <roleName>Bishop</roleName> <persName ref="#Harold_Browne">Harold Browne</persName>, who died in
              <date when="1891">1891</date>. A very beautiful iron grille that once protected the shrine of
              <placeName ref="#St_Swithun" type="shrine">St. Swithun</placeName> now covers a door on the north side of the nave. Certain
              of the piers in the nave were repaired in <date when="1826-07">1826-7</date> and the <emph>"restorer"</emph>,
              one <persName ref="#Garbett">Garbett</persName>, inserted _iron_ engaged columns on the face of that
              one nearest to <placeName ref="#Bishop_Edyngton_s_chantry" type="chantry">Bishop Edyngton's chantry</placeName>, it is said for the sake
              of economy and strength! Some of the stained glass in the nave,
              according to Mr. Le <persName ref="#Coutier">Coutier</persName>, dates from the time of <roleName>Bishop</roleName> <persName ref="#Edyngton">Edyngton</persName>,
              and that representing <persName ref="#Richard_II">Richard II</persName> is a work contemporary with <roleName>Bishop</roleName>
              <persName ref="#Wykeham">Wykeham</persName>. This part of the building has been the scene of many
              progresses--magnificent and sad--from the coronation processions of
              the early kings and the slow march of their funerals to that of the
              wedding of <persName ref="#Mary_I">Mary I</persName>, when the queen blazed with jewels "to such an
              extent that the eye was blinded as it looked upon her." 
              But the most unforgettable of all was on that dreadful day when the troops of
              <persName ref="#Waller">Waller</persName> marched up the nave, some mounted and all in war array, to
              despoil the tombs of bishop and knight of their emblems of piety and
              honour and to destroy anything beautiful that could be reached with pike or sword.</p>
                  
            <p>On the right of the choir steps is <placeName ref="#Bishop_Edyngton_s_chantry" type="chapel">Bishop Edyngton's chantry</placeName> and on
               first <roleName type="dean">Dean</roleName>. In the centre of the choir stands the reputed tomb of
                the left the grave of the last <roleName type="prior">Prior</roleName>, <persName ref="#Kingsmill">Kingsmill</persName>, who afterwards became
               first <roleName type="dean">Dean</roleName>. In the centre of the choir stands the reputed tomb of
               <persName ref="#William_Rufus">William Rufus</persName>. This part of the building forms a mortuary chapel for
               several of the early <persName ref="#English">English</persName> Kings, including <persName ref="#Canute">Canute</persName>. Their remains,
               with those of several bishops, rest in the oak chests that lie on the
               top of the choir screen. They were deposited here by <roleName>Bishop</roleName> <persName ref="#Fox">Fox</persName> in
               <date when="1534">1534</date>. This prelate was responsible for the beautiful east window; a
               perfect specimen of old stained glass. The fine pulpit dates from
               <date when="1520">1520</date>. In the choir, the scene of <eventName>Edward Confessor's coronation</eventName> in
               <date when="1043">1043</date>, <persName ref="#Mary_I">Mary I</persName> and <persName ref="#Philip">Philip</persName> of <placeName ref="#Spain" type="nation">Spain</placeName> were married. The fine carvings of
               the stalls date from <date when="1296">1296</date> and their canopies from <date when="1390">1390</date>. They are among
               the earliest specimens of their kind in <placeName ref="#Europe" type="continet">Europe</placeName>.</p>
